# async-and-sync-sleeps
## Example in Javascript showing use of async/await construction

Just exploring async and sync using an implementation of a true "sleep" function.

For starters, as many will jump right in and tell me, using a true 'sleep()' function (as opposed to setTimeout() or setInterval()) is muy bad practice in Javascript. 
No doubt that's true.  I'm grateful to the discussion [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/951021/what-is-the-javascript-version-of-sleep) for insights, advice, and better methods

This is just an exercise for me to gain a little insight into the async/await construct.  

### To install:

Clone into a directory

cd to directory

`npm install`

### To run:

To see synchronous execution: 

`npm run sync_sleep`

To see asynchronous execution:

`npm run async_sleep`
