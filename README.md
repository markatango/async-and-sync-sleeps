# async-and-sync-sleeps
## Example in Javascript showing use of async/await construction

Just exploring async and sync using an implementation of a true "sleep" function.

For starters, as many will jump right in and tell me, using a true 'sleep' function (as opposed to SetTimeout() or SetInterval()) is muy bad practice in Javascript. 
No doubt that.'s true.

This is just an exercise for me to gain a little insight into the async/await construct.  

### To install:

Clone into a directory
cd to directory
npm install

### To run:

To see synchronous execution: 

`npm run sync_sleep`

To see asynchronous execution:

`npm run async_sleep`
